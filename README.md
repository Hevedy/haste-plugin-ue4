### Example
<pre>
cd ShooterGame
mkdir Plugins
cd Plugins
git clone https://github.com/coderespawn/haste-plugin-ue4.git Haste
</pre>

This would create a folder named Haste inside the Plugins folder and clone the repository into it

### Example (if your main game code is already in git)
You can clone the plugin into your game's existing git repository as a sub module
<pre>
cd ShooterGame
mkdir Plugins
git submodule add https://github.com/coderespawn/haste-plugin-ue4.git Plugins/Haste
</pre>
